# MESON
Parser for the [MESON esoteric knowledge representation format](https://esolangs.org/wiki/MESON), written in Haskell.

May be expanded to support the full [ESON format](https://esolangs.org/wiki/ESON) at a later date.

The main function for the Haskell program simply reads input MESON from standard input, then writes its internal representation of the parsed MESON to standard output.
